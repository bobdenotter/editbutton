Quick Edit Button
=================

A nifty little extension to add a button to quickle edit any record in Bolt.
All 'record detail' pages will show a button in one of the corners, to take you
directly to that page in Bolt's backend.

Edit the `config.yml` to configure the location, and the label on the button.
